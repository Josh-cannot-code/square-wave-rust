# A *"Square Wave"* Fractal Written in Rust

This project was inspired by Kinetrika, a kinetic art piece
made from wireframe squares. Website: https://kinetrika.com/

I have done this project before using Python and Matplotlib:
https://github.com/Josh-cannot-code/square-wave-fractal. I was
not happy with the result and the code ended up being 
quite messy. This version is written in Rust and uses the
Glium library: https://github.com/glium/glium to interface with
OpenGL.

At the top of the main function there are some parameters
which can be changed to modify the fractal and its animation.
